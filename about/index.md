<p><strong>Hi!</strong></p>

<p>My name is Emma, welcome to my blog üë©‚Äçüíª</p>
</br>
<p>I am a budding Web Developer and have been coding regularly for over two years. I first discovered coding while on maternity leave back in 2019. I wanted something to do at home that would keep my brain engaged. Since then I have created two web apps using JavaScript and Javascript React and have also been taking a part-time course on the JAM Stack with the Coders Guild. I have learned so much and I am excited to continue to improve my coding skills!</p>
</br>
<p>The long term goal is to move careers into a full-time development role. I would love to complete an apprenticeship so this is my next goal to work towards.</p>
